"""Blackwell (SM100) sparse KV-outer forward — GQA-packed, one tile per work-item.

Each persistent work-item is one **128-row tile of packed (query, qhead) rows** drawn
from a single ``(hkv, kv_block)``. A block selected by ``count`` queries has
``count*qhead`` virtual rows (numbered head-fastest, ``virtual = query*qhead + head``,
so the qhead divide is by a compile-time constant); these are split into
``ceil(count*qhead/128)`` tiles. The tile loads the block's 128 keys once and does ONE
QK over the full block, ONE softmax, ONE PV — no sub-block / qhead / q-tile loops.

This packs the whole GQA group (and multiple queries) into the MMA's M dimension, so a
single K load serves up to 128 rows of compute. Versus a (block, qhead) work-item it
both shares K/V across the group AND collapses the per-tile pipeline overhead that
dominates low-reuse (sparse) workloads — e.g. one 16-row tile instead of sixteen 1-row
tiles. Work-items == total tiles keeps SM occupancy high even when few blocks are
selected (the block's queries fan out across tiles/CTAs).

Reuses FA4 per-tile primitives (``softmax_step``, ``correction_epilogue``) and pipeline
classes. The gather/scatter/mask paths decode each row's ``(query, head, rank)``.
Outputs per-(q, rank) partials (default ``O_partial`` dtype matches ``q`` for bandwidth;
pass ``partial_dtype=torch.float32`` for tighter correctness checks):
  TILE-ORDERED ``O_partial [Hkv*Tq*topK*qhead, D]`` + stats ``(m~, l) [Hkv, Tq*topK*qhead]``
  by pair position p, plus the inverse map ``inv [Hkv, Tq, topK] -> p`` for the combine.
